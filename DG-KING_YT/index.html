                        HERE EV Charge Points is a RESTful API that provides lists of charging stations within a specified area, including data on connector types, opening hours, and their location. EV Charge Points API also provides dynamic data about connector availability at charging stations for electric vehicles, including full detailed and dynamic data for specific individual stations.

The EV Charge Points API supports the following use cases:

Show lists of charging stations with information on location and facilities along a planned route or at a specified location.
Find charging stations with the correct type of charging connector for your electric vehicle.
There are four types of electric vehicles available:

Battery Electric Vehicle (BEV):Fully powered by electricity. These are more efficient compared to hybrid and plug-in hybrids.
Hybrid Electric Vehicle:
Hybrid Electric Vehicle (HEV): The vehicle uses both the internal combustion (usually petrol) engine and the battery-powered motor powertrain. The petrol engine is used both to drive and charge when the battery is empty. These vehicles are not as efficient as fully electric or plug-in hybrid vehicles.
Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicle (PHEV): Uses both an internal combustion engine and a battery charged from an external socket (they have a plug). This means the vehicle’s battery can be charged with electricity rather than the engine. PHEVs are more efficient than HEVs but less efficient than BEVs.
Fuel Cell Electric Vehicle (FCEV):Electric energy is produced from chemical energy. For example, a hydrogen FCEV.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
BEVs are also known as All-Electric Vehicles (AEV). Electric Vehicles using BEV technology run entirely on a battery-powered electric drivetrain. The electricity used to drive the vehicle is stored in a large battery pack which can be charged by plugging into the electricity grid. The charged battery pack then provides power to one or more electric motors to run the electric car. To find out more about BEVs, click below.HEVs are also known as series hybrid or parallel hybrid. HEVs have both engine and electric motor. The engine gets energy from fuel, and the motor gets electricity from batteries. The transmission is rotated simultaneously by both engine and electric motor. This then drives the wheels. To find out more about HEVs, click below.The PHEVs are also known as series hybrids. They have both engine and a motor. You can choose among the fuels, conventional fuel (such as petrol) or alternative fuel (such as bio-diesel). It can also be powered by a rechargeable battery pack. The battery can be charged externally. To find out more about PHEVs, click below.FCEVs are also known as Zero-Emission Vehicles. They employ ‘fuel cell technology’ to generate the electricity required to run the vehicle. The chemical energy of the fuel is converted directly into electric energy. To find out more about FCEVs, click below.

Electric vehicles (EVs) use electricity
as their primary fuel or to improve
the effciency of conventional vehicle
designs. EVs include all-electric
vehicles, also referred to as battery
electric vehicles (BEVs), and plug-in
hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs). In
colloquial references, these vehicles
are called electric cars, or simply EVs,
even though some of these vehicles
still use liquid fuels in conjunction
with electricity. EVs are known for
providing instant torque and a quiet
driver experience.
Other types of electric-drive vehicles
not covered here include hybrid
electric vehicles, which are powered by
a conventional engine and an electric
motor that uses energy stored in a
battery that is charged by regenerative
braking, not by plugging in, and fuel
cell electric vehicles, which use a
propulsion system similar to electric
vehicles, where energy stored as
hydrogen is converted to electricity by
the fuel cell.
All-Electric Vehicles
All-electric vehicles do not have
conventional engines but are driven solely
by one or more electric motors powered
by energy stored in batteries. The batteries
are charged by plugging the vehicle into

                            1. Traction Battery Pack
Traction battery pack is also known as Electric vehicle battery (EVB). It powers the electric motors of an electric vehicle. The battery acts as an electrical storage system. It stores energy in the form DC current. The range will be higher with increasing kW of the battery. The life and operation of the battery depends on its design. The lifetime of a traction battery pack is estimated to be 200,000 miles.
<br>
2. DC-DC Converter
DC DC Converter
The traction battery pack delivers a constant voltage. But different components of electric vehicle has different requirements. The DC-DC convertor distributes the output power that is coming from the battery to a required level. It also provides the voltage required to charge the auxiliary battery.
<br>
3. Electric motor
Electric Motor of a Car
Electric traction motor is the main components of electric vehicles. The motor converts the electrical energy into kinetic energy. This energy rotates the wheels. Electric motor is the main components of electric vehicle that differentiates an electric car from conventional cars. An important feature of an electric motor is the regenerative braking mechanism. This mechanism slows down the vehicle by converting its kinetic energy into another form, and storing it for future use. There are basically two types of motors DC and AC motors.

4. Power Inverter
It coverts DC power from the batteries to AC power. It also converts the AC current generated during regenerative braking into DC current. This is further used to recharge the batteries. The inverter can change the speed of the

5. Charge Port
Electric Car Charging Port
The charge port connects the electric vehicle to an external supply. It charges the battery pack. The charge port is sometimes located in the front or rear part of electric vehicle components.
<br>
6. Onboard charger
Onboard Charger of EV Car
Onboard charger is used to convert the AC supply received from the charge port to DC supply. The on-board charger is located and installed inside the car. It monitors various battery characteristics and controls the current flowing inside the battery pack.
<br>
7. Controller
Electric Bike Controller
Power electronics controller determines the working of an electric car. It performs the regulation of electrical energy from the batteries to the electric motors. The pedal set by the driver determines the speed of the car and frequency of variation of voltage that is input to the motor. It also controls the torque produced.
<br>
8. Auxiliary batteries
Auxiliary Battery
Auxiliary batteries are the source of electrical energy for the accessories in electric vehicles. In the absence of the main battery, the auxiliary batteries will continue to charge the car. It prevents the voltage drop, produced during engine start from affecting the electrical system.
<br>
9. Thermal system(cooling)
The thermal management system is responsible for maintaining an operating temperature for the main components of electric vehicle (EV) such as, electric motor, controller etc. It functions during charging as well to obtain maximum performance. It uses a combination of thermoelectric cooling, forced air cooling, and liquid cooling.
<br>
10. Transmission
Speed Tranmission
The gearbox transfers the mechanical power from the electric motor to the wheels. The advantage of electric cars is that they do not require multi-speed transmissions. The transmission efficiency should be high to avoid power loss.
